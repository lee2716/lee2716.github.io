## Education

I received the **B.S. degree** in **Communications Engineering** from the [**University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Zhongshan Institute**](https://www.zsc.edu.cn/), in 2023. During my undergraduate studies, I participated in a two-year **Exchange Program** at the [**University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)**](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), where I deepened my knowledge in **Telecommunications**, **Digital Signal Processing**, and **Machine Learning**.

Currently, I am pursuing an **M.S. degree** in **Telecommunications Engineering** at the [**University of Bologna (UNIBO)**](https://www.unibo.it/en), where, in addition to deepening my knowledge of **Telecommunications**, I have also expanded my expertise in **Deep Learning** and **Computer Architecture for AI**. This interdisciplinary experience has provided me with diverse perspectives to understand and analyze the world, allowing me to approach engineering challenges with a broader mindset, model the world in new ways, and explore innovative solutions through **AI-Driven Techniques**.

## Interests

My motivation stems from the transformative potential of **AI** to address real-world challenges. I am focused on deploying **Deep Learning Models** in **Embedded Systems**, combining my passion for **Deep Learning** and **AI-Driven Solutions**.
